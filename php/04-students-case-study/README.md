# A simple students management app
This is a very simple example without a database.
Students are hardcoded in a file which is included in order to be used by the several pages.

- display_students: Displays the students as a list based on their major. Uses the GET method.
- search_students: Displays the students having the submitted name. Uses the POST method.
